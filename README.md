# R2D2â€”Release Request Detection and Deployment

The R2D2 system allows tags to be created from PRs.

This action is built specifically for Cosmos SDK release practices. Please open an issue if you'd like it generalized to support your use case.

# Cosmos SDK Usage

A PR should be made to update the changelog of the package that needs the new tag. 
The changelog should include the new version you're trying to tag.

For example:

`x/tx/changelog.md`
```markdown
# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/x/tx/v2.0.0) - 2025-05-20
```

A PR with this changelog update will push the tag `x/tx/v2.0.0`.

# Required Environment Variables
